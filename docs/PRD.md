# 🧠 SYLO V2 — Enhanced Product Requirements Document

## 🧾 Executive Summary

Sylo is a **headless agent configuration and routing engine** that solves the critical security and complexity barriers preventing AI agents from accessing real productivity tools. Unlike automation platforms built for humans, Sylo is purpose-built for AI agents — providing secure OAuth management, structured context compilation, and standardized command routing.

**The Problem**: Creative professionals want AI assistants that can actually manage their studios by reading emails, updating projects, and coordinating workflows. Current solutions either require manual data entry or expose sensitive credentials to third-party AI services.

**The Solution**: Sylo leverages Nango's enterprise OAuth platform to act as a secure bridge, eliminating all OAuth complexity while generating MCP (Model Context Protocol) configurations that enable any LLM to autonomously manage connected productivity tools without ever seeing raw credentials.

**Key Differentiators**:

- **Nango-powered OAuth**: Enterprise-grade OAuth management for 200+ integrations with zero implementation complexity
- **Security-first architecture**: SOC2 compliance built-in via Nango + additional encryption layers
- **LLM-agnostic MCP standard compliance**: Universal AI agent compatibility
- **Purpose-built for AI agents**: Not human workflows, designed for autonomous operation
- **Innovative media generation**: Google Veo 2 integration for creative automation

### Security Architecture

#### OAuth Security Implementation

```typescript
// PKCE OAuth Flow
const generateOAuthURL = (service: string, userId: string) => {
  const codeVerifier = generateCodeVerifier() // 128 chars
  const codeChallenge = base64URLEncode(sha256(codeVerifier))

  await redis.setex(`oauth:${userId}:${service}`, 600, codeVerifier)

  return buildAuthURL({
    client_id: process.env[`${service.toUpperCase()}_CLIENT_ID`],
    redirect_uri: `${process.env.BASE_URL}/auth/callback/${service}`,
    scope: getRequiredScopes(service),
    code_challenge: codeChallenge,
    code_challenge_method: 'S256',
    state: signJWT({ userId, service }),
  })
}
```

#### Token Encryption

```typescript
const encryptToken = (token: string): string => {
  const cipher = crypto.createCipher('aes-256-gcm', process.env.ENCRYPTION_KEY)
  const encrypted = cipher.update(token, 'utf8', 'hex') + cipher.final('hex')
  const tag = cipher.getAuthTag().toString('hex')
  return `${encrypted}:${tag}`
}
```

#### Webhook Authentication

```typescript
const validateWebhookSignature = (payload: string, signature: string): boolean => {
  const expectedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET)
    .update(payload)
    .digest('hex')
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(signature), Buffer.from(expectedSignature))
}
```
